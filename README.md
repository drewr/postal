#### Internet email library for Clojure

Postal is a library for constructing and sending RFC822-compliant
Internet email messages.  It wraps the JavaMail package for message
and SMTP support.  It supports sendmail natively.  Supports STARTTLS &
SSL.

### Platforms

* Anything that can run Java should work
* sendmail support likely requires *nix, but `msmtp`, et al., are worthy substitutes
* Untested on Windows

### Dependencies

* JavaMail 1.4.2 (in `lib/` after build)

### Install

Served by Clojars.  In your project.clj:

    [com.draines/postal "1.7-SNAPSHOT"]

Likewise substitute any tag, like `1.6.0` etc.

### Examples

At a bare minimum, provide a map with `:from` and `:to` (and you'll
probably also be wanting `:subject` and `:body`, though they're
technically optional).  This will locally inject the message into
sendmail.

    user> (in-ns 'postal.core)
    #<Namespace postal.core>
    postal.core> (send-message {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to ["mom@example.com" "dad@example.com"]
                                :cc "bob@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body "Test."})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core> 

To use SMTP, add metadata with a `:host` key.

    postal.core> (send-message #^{:host "mail.isp.net"}
                               {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to "foo@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body "Test."})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core> 

Authenticate to SMTP server with `:user` and `:pass`.

    postal.core> (send-message #^{:host "mail.isp.net"
                                  :user "jsmith"
                                  :pass "sekrat!!1"}
                               {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to "foo@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body "Test."})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core> 

You probably do not want to do this in the clear, so add `:ssl` to get
an encrypted connection.  This will default to port `465` if you don't
specify one.

If your destination supports TLS instead, you can use `:tls`.  This
will default to port `25`, however, so if you need a different one
make sure you supply `:port`.  (It's common for ISPs to block outgoing
port 25 to relays that aren't theirs.  Gmail supports SSL & TLS but
it's easiest to just use SSL since you'll likely need port 465
anyway.)

    postal.core> (send-message #^{:host "smtp.gmail.com"
                                  :user "jsmith"
                                  :pass "sekrat!!1"
                                  :ssl :yes!!!11}
                               {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to "foo@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body "Test."})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core> 

Attachments and multipart messages can be added as sequences of maps:

    postal.core> (send-message #^{:host "mail.isp.net"}
                               {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to "foo@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body [{:type "text/html"
                                        :content "<b>Test!</b>"}
                                       ;;;; supports both dispositions:
                                       {:type :attachment
                                        :content (java.io.File. "/tmp/foo.txt")}
                                       {:type :inline
                                        :content (java.io.File. "/tmp/foo.txt")}]})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core>

You can stress-test a server by:

    postal.core> (stress #^{:host "localhost"
                            :num     1000
                            :delay   250   ;; msecs
                            :threads 5     ;; concurrent connections}
                         {:from "foo@lolz.dom"
                          :to "bar@lolz.dom"})
    sent 1000 msgs to localhost:25
    nil
    postal.core>
