postal
=======

#### Internet email library for Clojure

postal is a library for constructing and sending RFC822-compliant
Internet email messages.  It wraps the Jakarta Mail package for message
and SMTP support.  It supports sendmail natively.  Supports STARTTLS &
SSL.

### Platforms

* Anything that can run Java should work
* sendmail support likely requires *nix, but `msmtp`, et al., are worthy substitutes
* Untested on Windows

### Dependencies

* Jakarta Mail (in `lib/` after build)
* Java 8+

### Install

Served by Clojars.  In your Leiningen project.clj:

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/com.draines/postal.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.draines/postal)

Likewise substitute any tag name from git.

### Examples

#### Local

At a bare minimum, provide a map with `:from` and `:to` (and you'll
probably also be wanting `:subject` and `:body`, though they're
technically optional).  Any other keys you supply will show up as
ancillary headers.  This example will locally inject the message into
whatever sendmail-compatible interface your system provides.

    user> (in-ns 'postal.core)
    #<Namespace postal.core>
    postal.core> (send-message {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to ["mom@example.com" "dad@example.com"]
                                :cc "bob@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body "Test."
                                :X-Tra "Something else"})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core>

#### SMTP

To use SMTP, add an argument map before the message with at least
`:host` key.

    postal.core> (send-message {:host "mail.isp.net"}
                               {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to "foo@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body "Test."})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core>

For legacy compatibility, you can also supply these connection
parameters as metadata on the message.  `(send-message ^{:host ...} {:from ...})`

#### Authentication

Authenticate to SMTP server with `:user` and `:pass`.

    postal.core> (send-message {:host "mail.isp.net"
                                :user "jsmith"
                                :pass "sekrat!!1"}
                               {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to "foo@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body "Test."})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core>

#### Encryption (Gmail example)

You probably do not want to do this in the clear, so add `:ssl` to get
an encrypted connection.  This will default to port `465` if you don't
specify one.

If your destination supports TLS instead, you can use `:tls`.  This
will default to port `25`, however, so if you need a different one
make sure you supply `:port`.  (It's common for ISPs to block outgoing
port 25 to relays that aren't theirs.)

    postal.core> (send-message {:host "smtp.gmail.com"
                                :user "jsmith@gmail.com"
                                :pass "sekrat!!1"
                                :port 587
                                :tls true}
                               {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to "foo@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body "Test."})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core>
    
(Despite [the documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600)
mentioning SSL, your Google account is most likely restricted to TLS on port `587` and 
furthermore you may have to configure your account to
["allow less secure apps"](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) in order to send emails.)

#### Amazon

Since Amazon SES uses authenticated SMTP, postal can use it.  Just
make sure you use a verified address and your SMTP credentials (visit
the AWS Console to set those up).  Also, if you're just sandboxing,
you can only send *to* a verified address as well.  Example:

    postal.core> (send-message {:user "AKIAIDTP........" :pass "AikCFhx1P......."
                                :host "email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
                                :port 587}
                   {:from "me@draines.com" :to "me@draines.com"
                    :subject "Test from Amazon SES" :body "Test!!!11"})
    {:error :SUCCESS, :code 0, :message "messages sent"}
    postal.core>

#### Attachments

Attachments and multipart messages can be added as sequences of maps:

    postal.core> (send-message {:host "mail.isp.net"}
                               {:from "me@draines.com"
                                :to "foo@example.com"
                                :subject "Hi!"
                                :body [{:type "text/html"
                                        :content "<b>Test!</b>"}
                                       ;;;; supports both dispositions:
                                       {:type :attachment
                                        :content (java.io.File. "/tmp/foo.txt")}
                                       {:type :inline
                                        :content (java.io.File. "/tmp/a.pdf")
                                        :content-type "application/pdf"}]})
    {:code 0, :error :SUCCESS, :message "message sent"}
    postal.core>

If your attachment has a content-type that is not recognized by
Jakarta Mail, e.g., `.pdf` or `.doc`, you can set `:content-type`.  You
can also set `:file-name` and `:description` if you don't like the
filename that `:content` uses.

If you want another multipart type than "mixed", you can specify it as a keyword
as the first value in the map sequence. That way you can for example create an
HTML-Email that displays a text message as fallback in email clients that do not
support (or suppress) HTML-mails:

    postal.core> (send-message {:host "localhost"
                                :port 2500
                                :user "user@localhost"
                                :pass "somePassword"}
                           {:from "jon-doe@example.com"
                            :to "jane-doe@example.com"
                            :subject "multipart/alternative test"
                            :body [:alternative
                                   {:type "text/plain"
                                    :content "This is a test."}
                                   {:type "text/html"
                                    :content "<html><head> </head><body>
                                    <h1>Heading 1</h1><p>This is a test.</p>
                                    </body></html>"}
                                  ]}))

#### UTF-8

Postal uses Jakarta Mail underneath, which defaults to charset
`us-ascii`. To set the charset, set the `:type`, like `"text/html; charset=utf-8"`.

#### Message ID

Postal will supply a message ID by default that looks like
`[random]@postal.[host]`.  You can customize this by supplying a
`:message-id` header with a function that takes no args.  The included
`postal.support/message-id` can be used if you'd like to make use of
its randomness and only customize the hostname.

    {:from "foo@bar.dom"
     :to "baz@bar.dom"
     :subject "Message IDs!"
     :body "Regards."
     :message-id #(postal.support/message-id "foo.bar.dom")}

#### User Agent

You can customize the default `User-Agent` header (by default
`postal/VERSION`).

    {:from "foo@bar.dom"
     :to "baz@bar.dom"
     :subject "Message IDs!"
     :body "Regards."
     :user-agent "MyMailer 1.0"}


#### Stress-testing

You can stress-test a server by:

    postal.core> (stress ^{:host "localhost"
                           :num     1000
                           :delay   250   ;; msecs
                           :threads 5     ;; concurrent connections}
                         {:from "foo@lolz.dom"
                          :to "bar@lolz.dom"})
    sent 1000 msgs to localhost:25
    nil
    postal.core>
